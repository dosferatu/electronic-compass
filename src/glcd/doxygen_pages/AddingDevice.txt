\page AddingDevice

To add a custom device (microcontroller) implementation, you may wish to check out the source code of the existing devices for some guidance. Note that references to "device" refers to a microcontroller, not the graphics controller.

The device specific code is stored under:

    devices/
	
For example, files relating to NXP LPC111x are:
    - devices/LPC111x.c
	- devices/LPC111x.h
	
These files define behaviour which are specific to that device. Behaviour specific to a type of device should be <b>not</b> placed in any other directory other than this.

These files should have functions for all those required by glcd_devices.h

\see FunctionsDevices

The corresponding devices/mydevice.h should be used as well to store all required constants. Try and avoid using "magic numbers" in the code. This header file should also be used to store port and pin information for the implementation.

Example:

\code
#define PCD8544_SPI_PORT_NUMBER 1
#define PCD8544_MOSI_PORT LPC_GPIO2
#define PCD8544_MOSI_PIN  3
#define PCD8544_MISO_PORT LPC_GPIO2
#define PCD8544_MISO_PIN  2
#define PCD8544_SCK_PORT  LPC_GPIO2
#define PCD8544_SCK_PIN   1
#define PCD8544_SS_PORT   LPC_GPIO2
#define PCD8544_SS_PIN    0
#define PCD8544_DC_PORT   LPC_GPIO2
#define PCD8544_DC_PIN    4
#define PCD8544_RST_PORT  LPC_GPIO2
#define PCD8544_RST_PIN   5
\endcode
 
If certain code is specific to a controller and is not universal, use ifdef statements to isolate them e.g:

\code
#if defined(GLCD_CONTROLLER_PCD8544)
	/* insert code */
#else
	/* Use a meaningful error message */
	#error "Controller not supported for LPC111x"
#endif
\endcode
