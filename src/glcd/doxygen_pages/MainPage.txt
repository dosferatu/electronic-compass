\section Introduction Introduction

Welcome to GLCD, an open source graphic LCD library written by Andy Gock.

http://micro.gock.net/

https://github.com/andygock/glcd

This library has been written cleanly, to allow easy modification for use with different microcontroller devices and controller chipsets. Logic relating to devices and controllers are palced in seperate files and specific implementations can be chosen by the use of special defined symbols.

It is suitable for monochrome (black and white) LCDs with page by page data and command write style data transfer protocol.

\section SupportedControllers Supported Controllers

Current supported controllers:
- PCD8544 based LCDs, e.g Nokia 3110 and 5110 LCDs
- ST7565R serial interface (used in Newhaven Display NHD-C12864WC-FSW-FBW-3V3-M)
- NT75451 parallel interface (used on NGX BlueBoards)


\section SupportedDevices Supported Devices

Current supported devices:
- Atmel AVR 8-bit
- NXP LPC111x ARM Cortex
- NXP LPC11Uxx ARM Cortex

To be supported in the future:
- STM32

The following symbols need to be set for the compiler:

Pick microcontroller type (pick one only):
- GLCD_DEVICE_LPX111X
- GLCD_DEVICE_LPX11UXX
- GLCD_DEVICE_AVR8

Pick LCD controller type (pick one only):
- GLCD_CONTROLLER_PCD8544
- GLCD_CONTROLLER_ST7565R
- GLCD_CONTROLLER_NT75451

If using a parallel interface LCD (e.g NT75451 on NGX BlueBoard):
GLCD_USE_PARALLEL

When using SPI controllers:
GLCD_USE_SPI

Note the SPI symbol isn't checked, and it is fine if it is not used.
It is for forward compatibility only.

These symbols need to be set in the configuration options of your IDE, usually
in the "defined symbols" section, or they can be defined in a makefile
as -D options.

e.g "-DGLCD_DEVICE_LPC111X"

Also, we need to set the width and height of the LCD in glcd.h

\section CustomFonts Custom Fonts

Custom fonts can be generated using the free MikroElektronika GLCD Font Creator tool. The standard 5x7 tiny text font is included together with also a few extra custom fonts to get you started.
